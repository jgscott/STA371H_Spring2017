title: Week 1 (January 16-18, 2017)
---

Welcome to STA 371H!  On the first day of class, we'll give an overview of the course [(the course syllabus is here.)]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/syllabus_STA371_spring2017.pdf)  As a gentle introduction to the initial material, we will talk about some basic principles that separate good statistical graphics from bad ones.  

### Software

The first thing to do is to install [R](http://www.r-project.org) and then [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer.  Detailed instructions for installing these two programs [can be found here](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/basics/installing_R.html).  Both are free.

R is the underlying data-analysis program we'll use in this course, while RStudio provides a nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetitive steps (e.g. loading data, saving plots) very simple.   I will use RStudio in class most days this semester, and you will use it most weeks for your homework.  RStudio depends upon having R available behind the scenes, so make sure you install both, even though you won't need to interact directly with R.

Once you've installed R and RStudio, complete the following three R walkthroughs.  The first two are designed to get you off the ground, so if you're familiar with R, you can safely skip these.   
- [Getting started with R.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/heights/heights.html)   
- [Installing a library in R.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/basics/installing_library.html)    
- [Introduction to contingency tables.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/titanic/titanic.html)  
- [City temperatures](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/citytemps/citytemps.html) in San Diego and Rapid City.   
- [Test scores and GPA for UT graduates.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/sat/sat.html)    

### Reading

All readings are accessible through the Resources tab, above.  For this week, please read the introduction and Chapter 1 of the course packet.  The key topics are:
* continuous and categorical/grouping variables  
* contingency tables  
* simple summaries and graphics: histogram, boxplot, dotplot, scatter plot, lattice plot  
* variation between and within groups.  
* variation among numerical variables.  
* multivariate plots  

Optionally, you can also consult Chapter 1 of Kaplan.  This is mainly useful as an introduction to R.  Feel free to move rapidly if you're feeling comfortable with the software.  

### Supplemental reading

The material this week and next also coincides roughly with Chapter 1 of OpenIntro: Statistics.  As with the Kaplan book, you should not feel obligated to read this, but it would be a good supplement for anyone looking for additional study materials or review of your first statistics class.   

### Additional practice with R  

If you are feeling a little uncomfortable with the idea of R, do not worry.  We will practice a lot in class.  But if you'd like, you can get a jump start on things by following along with all the R commands in Chapters 1-3 of Kaplan.  Just replicate exactly what he does in your own R session.  Don't just copy and paste; actually type the commands yourself!  It's the best way to learn them.
