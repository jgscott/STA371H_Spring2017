title: Week 12 (April 10-12, 2017)
---

On Monday, we will finish Chapter 12 of the course packet, on independence and compounding.  Main topics include:  
- everyday risks and the compounding rule  
- using data to check for independence  
- lurking variables and mistaken compounding  
- mistaken compounding: the example of contraceptive effectiveness  

If there is any time available, we will introduce Chapter 13, on Bayes' rule.  

On Wednesday, we finish Chapter 13.  Key ideas:  
- prior and posterior probabilities  
- likelihood  
- confusion matrix  
- base-rate neglect   


### Software

You should base your homework this work off the [green_match.R]({{ site.baseurl }}/rscripts/green_match.R) script from a couple of weeks ago, which demonstrates the basic skills of matching (and matching + regression) for estimating a causal effect.  


### Readings

For Monday of next week, please read:
- All of Chapter 13, on Bayes' rule.  
- pages 281-291 (stopping at the top of page 292) on Chapter 14.  You can safely skip the subsection entitled "Advanced topic: a derivation of the binomial distribution."  


### Exercises  

[Exercises 7 this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises07-STA371H.pdf) are on cause-and-effect reasoning and basic probability.   They are due in class on April 17.
