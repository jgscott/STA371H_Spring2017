title: Week 8 (March 7-9, 2016)
---

There is no new material this week; we will hold a review session in class on Monday.

The midterm exam happens in class on Wednesday.  Please bring a pen and a blue book (which you can buy from the University Coop, and probably also from the Jester Store).

I will be holding "large-format" office hours this week in a classroom, rather than my office.  Bring questions; there is no other fixed agenda.  This session will take place on Monday, March 7th from 5:30 to 7:00 PM in UTC 3.104.  David will hold office hours on Tuesday evening as well (details forthcoming, pending my room reservation request).

My ordinarily scheduled office hours on Monday and Wednesday at 3:30 will not take place. 


### Extenuating circumstances  

Sometimes an emergency happens and someone has to miss the midterm. In such cases, I try my absolute best to not exacerbate a stressful situation, while simultaneously treating all students in the course fairly.  These goals are hard to balance, and that's why I follow the policies described in the course syllabus.  If you're unclear about how to handle the midterm should an emergency arise, please refer to the syllabus (on the "About" tab above), and ask me directly if you have any questions.
