title: Week 1 (January 20, 2016)
---

Welcome to STA 371H!  On the first day of class, we'll give an overview of the course [(the course syllabus is here.)]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/syllabus_STA371_spring2016.pdf)  As a gentle introduction to the initial material, we will talk about some basic principles that separate good statistical graphics from bad ones.  

### Software

The first thing to do is to install [R](http://www.r-project.org) and then [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org) on your own computer.  Detailed instructions for installing these two programs [can be found here](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/basics/installing_R.html).  Both are free.

R is the underlying data-analysis program we'll use in this course, while RStudio provides a nice front-end interface to R that makes certain repetitive steps (e.g. loading data, saving plots) very simple.   I will use RStudio in class most days this semester, and you will use it most weeks for your homework.  RStudio depends upon having R available behind the scenes, so make sure you install both, even though you won't need to interact directly with R.

Once you've installed R and RStudio, complete the following three R walkthroughs.  The first two are designed to get you off the ground, while the third kicks off our unit on exploratory data analysis by walking you through a few methods for analzying categorical data using contingency tables.

- [Installing a library in R.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/basics/installing_library.html)    
- [Introduction to contingency tables.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/titanic/titanic.html)  


### Readings

All readings are accessible through the Resources tab, above.

* Course packet: Introduction and Chapter 1.
* Chapter 1 of Kaplan: mainly useful as an introduction to R.  Feel free to move rapidly if you're feeling comfortable with the software.

The material this week and next also coincides roughly with Chapter 1 of OpenIntro: Statistics.  You should not feel obligated to read this, but it would be a good supplement for anyone looking for additional study materials or review of your first statistics class.  

### Additional practice with R  

If you are feeling a little uncomfortable with the idea of R, do not worry.  We will practice a lot in class.  But if you'd like, you can get a jump start on things by following along with all the R commands in Chapters 1-3 of Kaplan.  Just replicate exactly what he does in your own R session.  Don't just copy and paste; actually type the commands yourself!  It's the best way to learn them.
