We will go over the midterms in class on Monday.  For the curious among you, the curve formula used was: Curved Grade = 40 + 0.6*(Raw Score).  The mean raw score was about 73; the mean curved score was about 84.  


We will also begin our study of probability theory.  Topics for Monday:  
- interpretations of probability  
- coherence and Kolmogorov’s axioms  

Topics for Wednesday:  
- conditional probability and Bayes’ rule.  
- random variables and probability distributions.  
- expected value and variance.

### Reading

Please read Chapter 7 of the course packet, on probability.  For this week, you can safely stop at the bottom of page 184.

### Software 

Please complete the [walkthrough linked here](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/montecarlo/montecarlo_intro.html) that introduces you to the Monte Carlo method for approximating a probability distribution in a simple investment problem.  These commands will help you with problem 2 of the homework.  

### Exercises

This week's exercises (Homework 7, from the tab above) are about probability.  They are due in class on Monday, March 28, 2016.

A description of what to turn in for your class projects (due Friday, April) can be found [at this link]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/project-STA371H.pdf).
