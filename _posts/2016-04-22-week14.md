Topics for Wednesday:  
- logistic regression     


### Reading

Please finish reading Chapter 11 of the course packet.

For Wednesday, please read Chapter 12 of the course packet on generalized linear models.  You can stop at the bottom of page 282.  

### Software

For Monday, download the R script `saratoga_nlrm.R`.  For Wednesday, please complete [the walkthrough on logistic regression.](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/bballbets/bballbets.html).  


### Exercises

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises10-STA371H.pdf) contain two capstone case studies.  Hard-copy write-ups are due on the last day of the semester (Friday, May 6th, 2016, by 5 PM).  We will work on these in class next week.  

[Here is a video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/FfRvUEXCsvQ) of last week's bootstrap resampling exercises.  The accompanying R script is `bootstrap_VAR.R`, from the scripts tab above.
