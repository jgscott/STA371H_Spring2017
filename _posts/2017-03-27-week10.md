title: Week 10 (March 27-29, 2017)
---

At the beginning of class on Monday, we will finish up our in-class case study on "green" buildings.  See the update to the [green_match.R script.]({{ site.baseurl }}/rscripts/green_match.R)

For the next several weeks, we will switch gears from regression modeling and start to consider a different set of ideas: those surrounding probability and decision-making.  

On Monday, we will start Chapter 10 of the course packet aiming to cover:  
- expected value for repeated, independent events  
- the NP rule  
- the NNT in medicine  


On Wednesday, we will finish up Chapter 10, covering:  
- the basic rules of probability  
- probability distributions  

With whatever time remains on Wednesday, we will start into Chapter 11.  We will aim to cover:  
-  Joint, conditional, and marginal probabilities  
-  Rule of total probability   
-  Aggregation paradoxes in probability   


### Readings

By next Monday, please finish reading Chapters 10-11 of the course packet.
