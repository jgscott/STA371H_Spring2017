title: Week 4 (February 8-10, 2016)
---

On Monday, we will finish up Chapter 3 of the course packet and begin our unit on grouping variables in regression (Chapter 4).  Key topics:    
* review of naive prediction intervals   
* prediction intervals in the presence of transformations  
* the decomposition of variance (a.k.a. the Pythagorean theorem of statistics)  
* Aggregation paradoxes  


On Wednesday, we will continue with Chapter 4 of the course packet.  Key topics:   
* Dummy variables  
* Multiple grouping variables: main effects and interactions   
* analysis of variance (ANOVA)  
* Numerical and grouping variables together  
* Correlation among the predictors (collinearity)  

### Software

Outside of class, complete the following R walkthroughs.  
* [reaction time in video games](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/rxntime/rxntime.html): modeling numerical outcomes with more than one categorical predictor; dummy variables and interaction terms; analysis of variance.  
* [house prices](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/house/house.html): modeling numerical outcomes with both numerical and categorical predictors.  


### Readings

Please read Chapter 4 of the course packet.  


### Exercises  

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises03-STA371H.pdf) are about nonlinear regression and models involving grouping variables.   

Here's my take on the [last set of exercises.](https://youtu.be/9yppqHMkCE0).  The corresponding R script is available through the R Scripts tab, above.
