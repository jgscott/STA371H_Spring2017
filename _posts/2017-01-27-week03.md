title: Week 3 (January 30 - February 1, 2017)
---

On Monday, we will practice fitting nonlinear curves.  The in-class case study is on [finding an optimal price for milk](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/cases/milk/milk.md), given historical sales and price data.  This will finish out Chapter 2 of the course packet.  You might also want to check out the mini walkthrough on [how to optimize a function in R](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/optimize/optimize.md).

On Wednesday, we will learn to quantify forecasting error using prediction intervals.  We will also learn about the decomposition of variance.  This material comes from chapter 3 of the course packet.  


### Videos

Please watch the following videos to prepare for next week:  
- [Introduction to grouping variables in regression](https://youtu.be/wLP94JZuwHs).   
- [Dummy variables](https://youtu.be/owq2bL1rUsY).  
- [Multiple grouping variables: main effects and interactions](https://youtu.be/hCGHvilYSJ0).  
- [The analysis of variance](https://youtu.be/BT0z41NDK5Y).  


### Software practice  

Complete the following software walkthroughs.  For Wednesday in class:  
- [kidney function and aging](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/creatinine/creatinine.md): naive prediction intervals and the decomposition of variance  

For next week:  
- [reaction time in video games](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/rxntime/rxntime.md): modeling numerical outcomes with more than one categorical predictor; dummy variables and interaction terms; analysis of variance.   


### Readings

From the course packet, please read Chapter 3 by Wednesday.  For Monday of next week, please read Chapter 4 through page 94 (stopping at the section on "Numerical and grouping variables together.")


### Exercises  

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises02-STA371H.pdf) are about linear and nonlinear regression.  They are due on Monday, February 6 at the beginning of class.
