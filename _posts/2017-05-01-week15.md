title: Week 15 (May 1-3, 2017)
---

This week, we finish up the semester with one last topic: logistic regression.  For class on Monday, please download:  
- challenger.R from the R Scripts tab 
- challenger.csv from the Data tab  

In class on Wednesday, we will work on the second case study from this week's homework, on conditional probabilities in breast-cancer screening.  

### Reading

There is no new reading, but if you haven't read through page 327 of Chapter 16, then please do so.  Reminder from last week: you can safely stop once you reach the section entitled "Advanced topic: estimating the parameters of the logistic regression model."  You are not responsible for anything beyond this section.


### Software 

By Wednesday, please complete the [R walkthrough on logistic regression](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/bballbets/bballbets.md).

There are no new exercises.  [Exercises 9]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises09-STA371H.pdf), assigned last week, are due by 5 PM on the last day of the semester: Friday, May 5, 2017.  You may submit them either as a hard copy under my office door (CBA 6.478) or as an electronic PDF copy to statdropbox@gmail.com (same e-mail as for projects).
