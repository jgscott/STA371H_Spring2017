title: Week 10 (March 28-30, 2016)
---

This week, we continue our study of probability by learning to build parametric probability models for real-world systems.  We will finish up two important topics from last week.  

Topics for Monday:  
- random variables and probability distributions.  
- expected value and variance.
  
[Video here](https://youtu.be/ydV_wVU9Ti8), [slides here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/random_variables.pdf).

For Wednesday:  
- the binomial distribution.  
- the Poisson distribution.   
- Monte Carlo simulation based on parametric models.  

If time:  
- the normal distribution.  
- Monte Carlo simulation of stock portfolios.  


### Reading

Please read Chapter 8 of the course packet, on parametric probability models.For now, we will skip the material in Chapter 7 from page 184 onwards.  

### Software 

Please download the R scripts entitled `parametric_probmodels.R` (for Monday) and `montecarlo_normal.R` (for Wednesday) from the R Scripts tab above.  We will spend a little bit of time going over these in class, and you should finish working through them outside of class.  

### Exercises

There are no exercises this week.  Work on your projects instead.

Repost from last week: a description of what to turn in for your class projects (due Friday, April) can be found [at this link]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/project-STA371H.pdf).  There are also some suggestions for places to look for data.
