title: Week 11 (April 4-6, 2016)
---

This week, we continue our study of parametric probability models by talking about the normal distribution, the bivariate normal distribution, and the stock market.  

Topics for Monday:   
- the normal distribution.  
- Monte Carlo simulation of stock portfolios.  

Topics for Wednesday:  
- regression to the mean.   
- the bivariate normal distribution.  


### Reading

Please read the rest of Chapter 8 on the normal distribution.  For Wednesday, please read Chapter 9 on the bivariate normal distribution.  


### Software 

Please download the R scripts entitled `montecarlo_normal.R` (for Monday) and  `bivariate_normal.R` (for Wednesday) from the R Scripts tab above.  For the bivariate normal script to work, you will need to first install the `mvtnorm` library in R.  

### Exercises

There are no exercises this week.  Work on your projects instead.

Repost from last two weeks: a description of what to turn in for your class projects (due Friday, April) can be found [at this link]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/project-STA371H.pdf).
